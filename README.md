# Rubik’s Cube Solver with Water Drop

## About

This project is an interactive Rubik’s Cube solver developed as part of a university dissertation. It helps users solve a scrambled 3x3 Rubik’s Cube while keeping a special waterdrop sticker fixed in its position throughout the solving process.

The solver combines real-time camera scanning, colour recognition, a modified Kociemba algorithm, and an intuitive visual interface.

## Key Features

- **Camera-based Cube Scanning:** Scan each of the six faces using your webcam to capture the cube’s state.
- **Fixed Sticker Constraint:** The solver adapts the Kociemba algorithm to maintain the position of a waterdrop sticker during solving.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Step-by-step solution animation with visual feedback to track progress.
- **User Control:** Select the waterdrop sticker’s position before solving begins.

## Important Notes

- This code is designed specifically for the standard 3x3 Rubik’s Cube.
- The solver does not support other cube types (e.g., 2x2, 4x4, mirror cubes).
- The project assumes standard cube sticker colours and lighting conditions.
- The user interface provides basic controls without advanced customisation.
- This repository contains academic work created for a university dissertation.
